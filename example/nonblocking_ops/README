The purpose of this example is to define the difference between
"blocking" and "non-blocking" Operations.  See example_agent.py.

To run this example, you must first have the miniobs example up and
running (specifically you should run "make prepare" and "make up" in
../miniobs).

Then you can launch the agent, and send it to backgrouund::

  OCS_CONFIG_DIR=../miniobs python example_agent.py --instance-id example1 &

And you can launch the control client::

  OCS_CONFIG_DIR=../miniobs python example_ctrl.py

Note that in both cases we override the OCS_CONFIG_DIR environment
variable to be sure the scripts find ../miniobs/default.yaml, where
the crossbar configuration is.
